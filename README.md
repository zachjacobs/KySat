KySat iOS Application
=====================

Tracks satellites using by frequently requesting images from
[Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/). This is a component of a University of Kentucky CS 499 senior design project.

My contribution to this project is found in `KySat/KySatViewController.*` and the XCode 5 storyboard file, which only appears when the XCode 5 project is opened.
We hope to replace the default iOS image viewer with the following custom asynchronous image viewer that continually retrieves images: [AsynchImageView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/AsyncImageView).
