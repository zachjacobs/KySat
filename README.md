KySat iOS Application
=====================

Tracks satellites by requesting images from
[Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/). This is part of a University of Kentucky CS 499 senior design project.

The majority of this project's code is found in `KySat/KySatViewController*` and the XCode 5 storyboard file, which only appears when the XCode 5 project is launched. This application is modeled after the Anroid application that Kentucky Space developed, and a screenshot of our application is provided below.

Future improvements to this project include:

- Replacing the default iOS image viewer with the following custom asynchronous image viewer that continually retrieves images: [AsynchImageView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/AsyncImageView).
- Adding Kentucky Space's Twitter feed and pages about Kentucky Space and their satellites.
